  <h2>ðŸŽ‰ Welcome to the Hub! ðŸŽ‰</h2>
  
  <p>Hey ,</p>

  <p>With the #1 pick in the Scouting Draft of the Yearâ€¦ we choose <strong>YOU</strong>!</p>

  <p>As the official Commissioner of SCAH, weâ€™re proud to announce your draft into our elite insider circle.</p>

  <p>No trade clause. No combine needed. Just good vibes, big dreams, and a shared love for discovering greatness.</p>

  <p>We noticed your early interest in this bold vision weâ€™re buildingâ€”thank you! Youâ€™re now part of a special group getting sneak peeks, private updates, and maybe even a few top-secret scouting rumors (all legally SEC-compliantâ€¦ we promise ðŸ˜‰).</p>

  <p>We'll keep you in the loop as we gear up for launchâ€”and youâ€™ll be among the first to know when it's go-time.</p>

  <p>Until then, stretch those legs, shine your cleats, and get ready. The future of scouting starts nowâ€”and it starts with you.</p>

  <p>Welcome to the team.</p>

  <p>Sincerely,<br/>TheÂ SCAHÂ Team</p>
